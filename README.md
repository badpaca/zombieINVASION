# zombieINVASION
Monte Carlo simulation of a zombie pandemic with various parameters (resembles an SIR model).

A simple Monte Carlo simulation of a population with an initial zombie infection. 
The zombie infection can be thought of as any disease and this simulation can be used
to model any sort of spreading mechanism that takes place by random process. 

There are three states: susceptible, infected, and recovered. These take on various 
colors in the simulation. See comments in code for more details.
